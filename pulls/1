{"title":"Add golden validation harness, normalization helpers, manifest, metrics doc, and CI workflow","body":"This PR adds a golden validation harness and normalization helpers to enable deterministic regression tests for AI analysis outputs, plus a manifest for smoke/full samples, a METRICS.md guide, and a GitHub Actions workflow that runs smoke golden tests on PRs and a full golden evaluation nightly. Files added: src/MCMAA.Tests/GoldenTests/GoldenValidator.cs, src/MCMAA.Tests/GoldenTests/GoldenNormalization.cs, tests/Golden/manifest.json, tests/Golden/README.md, docs/METRICS.md, .github/workflows/golden-validation.yml. Instructions: run 'dotnet test src/MCMAA.Tests/' to execute the harness; add golden samples under tests/Golden/ with golden_<task>.json outputs; update METRICS.md for thresholds. Please create the PR and link CI artifacts when available."}
